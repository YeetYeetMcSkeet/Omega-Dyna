# Omega-Dyna
Omega Dyna is a platformer where you play as Dyna, a 12 year old on the planet Yeetus. Your sensei gets his neck snapped and you have to avenge him. Get powers 
killing bosses like in Mega Man, except this game series won't be dead for 10 years, come out with a new game, then immediately go back into hibernation for 
another 10 years. More coming. soon because I'm too lazy to write the rest of it right now.
